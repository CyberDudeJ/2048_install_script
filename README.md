# 2048 install script
This installs the 2048 game located at https://github.com/mevdschee/2048.c/blob/main/2048.c (made a fork so git clone would actually work without requiring a username and password).

# Running
Recommended to run as **root**, but is not required.

Simply downloade the code, using git clone or another method, and run (if in linux): ``python3 get3048.py``
This only works on linux.
